# # sets and its functions

# Sets
# A set is an unordered collection of iterable data which has no duplicate element and is also mutable
# 
# Since set is unordered and unindexed, the elements of a set cannot be accessed by their indexes, but as set has iterable data the elements can be accessed using a for loop
# 
# The elements of the set cannot be edited but new elements can be added into the set using the following methods:
# 
# add() is used to add single element
# update() is used to add multiple elements
# The elements can be removed from the sets using the following methods:
# 
# remove()
# discard()
# The difference between these methods is that if the element the user wants to remove is not present in the set remove() raises an error where as discard() doesn't
# 
# As set being unordered when we use pop() method we cannot predict which element is being poped out
# 
# clear() can be used to empty the set and del can be used to delete the set completely
# 
# Set class represents the mathematical notion of a set which allows the user to perform the basic mathematical operations of a set namely, symmetric_difference(), union(), intersection(), difference(), isdisjoint()
# 
# Similarly copy(), issubset(), issuperset() can be used on a set
